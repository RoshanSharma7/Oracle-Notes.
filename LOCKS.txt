======
	- to prevent unauthorized accessing for our resource.
	- oracle supports the following two types of locking mechanisms.
		1) Row level locking
		2) Table level locking

1) Row level locking:
=================
	- in this level oracle server is locking the rows from a table.
	- these are again two types.
		i) single row locking
		ii) multiple rows locking

i) single row locking:
==================
	- in this level oracle server is locking a single row from a table.

EX:
	User-1					User-2
	======					======
sql> conn system/tiger			sql> conn mydb4pm/myb4pm

sql> update mydb4pm.emp set sal=1100		sql> update emp set sal=2200
where empno=7369;				where empno=7369;
[ Here 7369 row is locked ]			[ we cannot perform update operation]

sql> commit / rollback;			1 row updated.
[ For releasing lock ]


ii) multiple rows locking:
=====================
	- in this level oracle server is locking multiple rows from a table.
	- if we want to lock multiple rows from a table then we must use 
	"for update" clause in SELECT command.

EX:
	User-1					User-2
	======					======
sql> conn system/tiger			sql> conn mydb4pm/myb4pm

sql> select * from mydb4pm.emp		sql> update emp set sal=3300
where deptno=10 for update;			where deptno=10;
[ Here deptno 10 rows are locked]		[ we cannot perform update operation]

sql> commit / rollback;			3 rows updated.
[ For releasing lock ]

Dead lock:
=========
	- both users are waiting for their resources.

EX:
	User-1					User-2
	======					======
sql> conn system/tiger			sql> conn mydb4pm/myb4pm

sql> update mydb4pm.emp set sal=4400		sql> update emp set sal=5500
where empno=7566;				where empno=7788;
[ Here 7566 row locked ]			[ Here 7788 row is locked ]

sql> update mydb4pm.emp set 		sql> update emp set sal=7700
sal=6600 where empno=7788;			where empno=7566;
[ we cannot perform update operation]		[ we cannot perform update operation]

ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00060: deadlock detected while 
waiting for resource.

sql> commit / rollback;			1 row updated.
[ for releasing dead lock ]

2) Table level locking:
==================
	- in this oracle server is locking the entire table.
		i) shared lock
		ii) execlusive lock

i) shared lock:
=============
	- In this locking both users can lock a table.
syntax:
=======
	lock table <table name> in share mode;

EX:
	User-1					User-2
	======					======
sql> conn system/tiger			sql> conn mydb4pm/myb4pm

sql> lock table mydb4pm.emp in share mode;	sql> lock table emp in share mode;
Table(s) Locked.				Table(s) Locked.
[ we cannot perform DML operations]		[ we cannot perform DML operations]

sql> update mydb4pm.emp set sal=9900		sql> update emp set sal=8800
where empno=7900;				where empno=7788;
[ not allowed ]				[ not allowed ]

sql> commit / rollback;			1 row updated.
[ for releasing lock ];

ii) Exclusive lock:
===============
	- in this locking mechanism any one user can lock the table.

syntax:
=======
	lock table <table name> in exclusive mode;

EX:
	User-1					User-2
	======					======
sql> conn system/tiger			sql> conn mydb4pm/myb4pm

sql> lock table mydb4pm.emp in exclusive  mode;	sql> lock table emp in exclusive mode;
Table(s) Locked.				[ we cannot lock a table]	

sql> commit / rollback;			Table(s) Locked.
[ for releasing lock ]
